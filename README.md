# 🧩 Emoji Cipher Decoder

A Python program for decrypting secret messages written entirely in emojis — because who says espionage can't be colorful? 🕶️✨

## 🔍 About the Project

This project was created as a playful exercise in Python, text processing, and cryptographic thinking. It deciphers emoji-encoded messages using a custom emoji-to-letter substitution cipher.

> Example encrypted message:
> ```
> 🌴🏠🍦🐍 🍦🐍 🍎 🥞🦄⚡⚡🦁🦅
> ```
> Decodes to:  
> `this is a puzzle`

Whether you're practicing Python fundamentals or hiding Easter eggs in your code, this project makes decoding a bit more delightful.
